# ruby-capstone

## Description

> In this project, we create a console app that will help us to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.
